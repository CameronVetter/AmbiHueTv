Phillips Hue Ambient Light Synced to a TV

A recent trend in televisions has been the addition of ambient lights behind the screen that is synchronized with the action on the screen. After adding some Phillips Hue lights to my home I wanted to see if I could achieve the same effect with extra parts I had laying around the house.

For this project you will need a USB webcam compatible with Windows 10 IOT, a Hue Bridge, and a Hue light bulb capable of color changing.
